/**
 * Class HomepageController.
 *
 * This seemingly inconspicuous class responds to the default site route callback and is intended to replace
 * the Drupal default of '/node', which is handled by a view and shows any content promoted
 * to the front page. This is bad news for two reasons:
 *
 * 1. The homepage is mostly comprised of blocks rendered into page regions.
 * 2. If a node is accidentally promoted to the front page using the 'frontpage' view, then it
 *    will begin to inject rendered nodes in some view mode alongside the defined blocks,
 *    and disrupt the display of the homepage.
 *
 * So by keeping our controller here, responding with an empty render array, we protect ourselves
 * from this rather large volume of proverbial egg destined for the face, and ensure that our
 * blocks can render in the regions without being bothered.

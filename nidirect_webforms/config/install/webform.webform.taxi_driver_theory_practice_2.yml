        <p>Prior to starting duty you carry out a check of your vehicle. Access to the passenger seating area is by the sliding doors on both sides of your vehicle or by the double doors at the rear. You realise the electric wheelchair ramp at the rear is defective. You have been having problems starting your vehicle first thing every morning so you replace the vehicle battery. Your first appointment is a party of 12 and 13 year old school children going to their school prom. You pick them up at various locations and take them to the venue, stopping on the near side of the road next to the kerb. On the way, the teenagers start moving around in the rear of the vehicle. To date you have attended two periodic training courses, one lasting 7 hours and one lasting 5 hours. You have another one scheduled for next week which meets the minimum time requirement.</p>

            <h4>Defensive driving</h4>

            <p>Take extra care if your path crosses or joins the path of other road users.</p>

            <p>Check your mirrors, particularly for cyclists and motorcyclists, when turning at junctions. They can approach very quickly from behind and are less easy to see than a larger vehicle.</p>
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "The Official DVSA Guide to DRIVING the essential skills". Section 8, Junctions.</p>'
        question_3:
          correct_answer: q3_a
          correct_feedback: '<p>If you know which light is going to show next you can plan your approach accordingly. This can help prevent excessive braking or hesitation at the junction.</p>'

        question_4:
          correct_answer: q4_a1
          correct_feedback: '<p>Traffic signs can be divided into three classes. Those giving orders, those warning and those informing. Warning signs are usually triangular and direction signs are generally rectangular. One notable exception to this is the octagonal ‘STOP’ sign.</p>'

        question_5:

          correct_feedback: |-
            <h4>Pelican crossings</h4>

            <p>These are light-controlled crossings where the pedestrian uses push-button controls to control the traffic. They have no red and<br />
            amber phase before the green. Instead they have a flashing amber light, which means you must give way to pedestrians on the crossing but if it’s clear you can go on. The crossing area is shown by studs and a ‘stop’ line marks the place for drivers to stop when it’s necessary.</p>
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "The Highway Code for NI". Rule 196.</p>'

          correct_answer: q6_a1
          correct_feedback: |-
            <h4>Pedestrians and cyclists</h4>

            <p>You should:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>give way to pedestrians already crossing when you turn – they have priority</li>
            	<li>keep a special lookout for cyclists coming up on your left</li>
            	<li>take special care when crossing a cycle track, bus or cycle lane</li>

            <p>Some warning lights if they remain on must be checked out immediately – Oil, Seatbelt, and Airbag etc. If possible you should stop somewhere safe and convenient and try to find the cause. You should also check your vehicle’s handbook for further information.</p>

            <p>Others such as the Particulate Filter warning light advise that action is required, but not necessarily immediately. If this light is illuminated it means that the particulate filer is upwards of 45% blocked with the soot residue from the burnt fuel from the engine.</p>

            <p>Depending on the make and model of your vehicle there are a number of actions you can take to extinguish this light. One such example is to drive your vehicle for a short time on higher than normal speed roads, such as a motorway, where the exhaust temperature can be raised sufficiently to burn off the residue which should extinguish the light. You should however consult your vehicle’s handbook for the appropriate action for your type of vehicle.</p>

            <p>Ensuring that daily walk-round checks are carried out will enable you to find any defects that could become a problem and cause the vehicle to break down or be driven while illegal.</p>

            <p>The time taken to complete a thorough check will be less than that required to organise repair or replacement while out on the road. Checks need to be made before you start up the vehicle or begin a journey. The consequences are too great to risk driving a vehicle with defective parts.</p>

            <p>The training MUST be delivered by an approved training provider and the course MUST have been approved by DVA before it can be uploaded against each taxi driver’s record.</p>

            <p>If after five years, you have not completed the minimum 35 hours training your taxi licence will not be renewed.</p>

            <p>These courses have a MINIMUM legal duration of 3 hours 30 minutes. Any course which does not comply with the legislation cannot be attributed to periodic training and uploaded against a driver’s record.</p>

            <p>In addition, if a course exceeds the minimum period but falls short of the next acceptable time period of 7 hours, (i.e. any time between 3 hours 30 minutes and 7 hours) the extra time cannot be attributed towards an individual’s periodic training record. Full details of the requirements for periodic training can be found via the Agency’s website at www.nidirect.gov.uk/Periodic training</p>

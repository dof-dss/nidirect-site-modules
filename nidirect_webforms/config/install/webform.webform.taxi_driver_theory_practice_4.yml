        <p><strong>Please carefully read the following scenario and then answer questions 11 to 15 which follow.</strong></p>

        <p>It‘s a lovely dry day and on the way to your next pick up, while driving at 40 mph, a van stops suddenly in front of you. While on route to the airport along the motorway, one of your wheel trims comes off. After picking up four passengers from the airport you come across a herd of cows with a farmer blocking the country road. Further along the country road which has no footpath, you encounter a lady pedestrian with a guide dog wearing a white harness waiting to cross the road. You drop the passengers from the airport off one by one. When you drop the last passenger, he refuses to pay the full amount, stating that the others should have paid their part of the fare when they were dropped off.</p>

          correct_feedback: |
            <p>It is essential that you remain calm during any situation and avoid doing or saying anything that implies you are asking them to leave the vehicle. Act in a confident manner and keep your behaviour in proportion to the provocation. You should:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>think about your approach;</li>
            	<li>be aware of warning signs and think ahead;</li>
            	<li>show that you are willing to listen;</li>
            	<li>avoid body language that could inflame the situation, such as pointing of fingers; and</li>
            	<li>inform the school and your company of any persistent problems.</li>
            </ul>
          incorrect_feedback: '<p>Please read "All you need to know to become a Taxi Driver". Section 1. Getting started.</p>'
        question_2:
          correct_answer: q2_a1
          correct_feedback: |
            <p>It’s unreasonable to expect the right child seat or booster to be available in a taxi unless a parent or carer has brought it<br />
            with them. There’s therefore a qualified exception which says that if child restraints aren’t available in a licensed taxi or licensed private hire vehicle</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>a child under three years old may travel unrestrained but in the rear only – this is the only exemption for a child under three years old</li>
            	<li>a child aged three years and above MUST use an adult belt in the rear seat only.</li>
            </ul>

          correct_answer: q3_a1
          correct_feedback: |
            <h4>Stopping at the roadside</h4>

            <p>All drivers have to stop at the side of the road, but as a taxi driver you have to think of your passengers at all times and ensure that, when you stop, your passengers are able to get in or out of your vehicle safely and conveniently.</p>

            <p>Make sure that</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>you pull up within a reasonable distance of the kerb, in a position that’s safe, legal and convenient</li>
            	<li>you apply the handbrake and put the gear into neutral before your passenger opens the door</li>
            	<li>your passengers can open the door fully and that their entry or exit isn’t blocked by trees or street furniture – lampposts, waste bins, signs, etc</li>

            <h4>Smoking in a taxi</h4>

            <p>Legislation was introduced in April 2007 in Northern Ireland concerning smoking in certain vehicles, this includes smoking in taxis.</p>

            <p>The law requires:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>any enclosed vehicle used by members of the public, including taxis, to be smoke-free. This means that neither the driver nor the passenger can smoke in a taxi; and</li>
            	<li>taxi vehicles MUST be smoke-free AT ALL TIMES even if there are no passengers in the vehicle or if the vehicle is being driven by a person other than the registered owner/driver, or when the vehicle is being used for personal business by either the registered owner/driver or any other person.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Therefore, you MUST NOT smoke in public transport vehicles or in vehicles used for work purposes. You MUST also display, in a prominent position, no-smoking signs and ensure that you are aware of, and adhere to, all the legal restrictions relating to the type of vehicle you drive.</p>

            <p>Failure to comply with the legislation can be reported to the Environmental Health Department who will carry out an investigation and any taxi driver who fails to prevent someone smoking in their vehicle can be prosecuted and fined up to a maximum of £2,500.</p>

            <p>Anyone found smoking in a taxi can be issued with a £50 fixed penalty notice or be prosecuted and face a fine of up to a maximum of £1,000.</p>

            <p>Failure to display the correct signage can result in a fixed penalty notice of £200 and if prosecuted carries a fine of up to £1,000.<br />

            <p>If you have the facility to carry wheelchairs you must ensure that you’re able to correctly load and secure the wheelchair so that the passenger can be transported safely and then reverse the process at the end of the journey.</p>

            <p>To load the wheelchair user you should</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>prepare for your passenger. Fit the wheelchair restraint and make space available for the wheelchair. Ensure the door is fully opened and secured. Pull out the ramp and add an extension if necessary</li>
            	<li>push the wheelchair user into the vehicle and stow the ramp. If you need to let go of the wheelchair to stow the ramp, make sure you apply the wheelchair brakes</li>
            	<li>position the wheelchair so that it can be secured using the equipment provided by the vehicle manufacturer</li>
            	<li>ensure that all straps and belts that secure the wheelchair and its user are fastened according to the manufacturer’s instructions</li>
            	<li>close the door.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To unload the wheelchair at the end of the<br />

            	<li>release the restraining straps and belts</li>
            	<li>pull out the ramp and fit the extension if it’s needed. If you need to move the wheelchair to do this, make sure you apply the brakes before letting go of the wheelchair</li>
            	<li>wheel out the wheelchair. Walk backwards for the safety of your</li>
            	<li>passenger and so that you can retain full control</li>

            <h4>Bends</h4>

            <p>Dealing effectively and safely with bends demands that you look well ahead and try to assess accurately how severe the bend is and at what speed you need to be travelling to negotiate it under control.<br />
            You should exercise sound judgement and a defensive approach.</p>

            <p>Where vision is restricted, be prepared to meet:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>oncoming vehicles</li>
            	<li>obstructions such as broken-down or slow-moving vehicles</li>
            	<li>pedestrians walking on your side of the road.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You should:</p>

            <ul>
            	<li>use the footbrake to control your speed on approach</li>
            	<li>choose the right gear for the road speed</li>
            	<li>use the accelerator carefully</li>

            <h4>Payment of fares</h4>

            <p>If a passenger refuses to pay their fare, you should not get into a situation where aggression or violence is allowed to develop. Where possible take the individuals name and address, note the reasons why they are refusing to make payment and pass this information onto your depot manager so he can take the necessary steps to address the issue. A passenger has a legal obligation to pay a fare providing no extenuating circumstances led to an increase in that fare which were not of their making.</p>

            <p>Animals. When passing animals, drive slowly. Give them plenty of room and be ready to stop. Do not scare animals by sounding your horn, revving your engine, or accelerating rapidly once you have passed them. Look out for animals being led, driven or ridden on the road and take extra care. Keep your speed down at bends and on narrow country roads. If a road is blocked by a herd of animals, stop and switch off your engine until they have left the road. Watch out for animals on unfenced roads.</p>
